## Overview 

This is the Cura profile that was made by ELEGOO and I modified it to work with the newest version of cura and removed some unused defaults. I have also added the STL of the bed from the original Neptune 2 STEP files

## How to install
Just download the master zip and drop the contents into your cura install folder or Appdata

## How to get icons on print screen

Install the MKS Wifi Plugin on the marketplace or here https://github.com/Jeredian/mks-wifi-plugin
Then after adding the printer click setting>printers>manage printers 
Click the MKS Wifi Connection 
Click add and when it promps for an IP address put 127.0.0.1
Then click image settings then click default
